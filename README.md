# Dependency:
    `npm install ng2-slim-loading-bar --save`
    `npm i ng2-search-filter --save`


# Initial Configuration
Clone the repo and execute `npm install` in the Node js server and into the Angular client.

## Execution of Data Base MongoDB

2. Ãˆxecute the command `mongo`
3. Execute into the mongo: `use nombre_bd`

## Execution of NodeJS Server
1. In the CMD, go to the server path
2. Enter the command `npm run dev`

## Execution of Angular Client

2. Enter the command `npm start`

# Error Solutions
For Error with: `rxjs` Go to the package.json and change: `"^6.1.0"` for this: `"6.1.0"`

# How the App Works

## Server Node JS
* Use the `server.js` for connecting to our database MongoDB y set the routes and define the port where will running the app
* Use the model entity file `Employee.js` for build our entity in the database mongoDB from the mongoose
* Use the routes for to create the business logic, Registers, login, find, etc.

## Client Angular
* Use the `proxy-config` for that instead of using: localhost:3000/ we will use: /employees
* In the `package.json` we tell him that starting the server with the proxy that I created previously
* Use the `Authentication.service.ts` for to create the methods that we will use for our authentication service
* Use the `Auth-guard.service.ts` for management the sesion and see the user logged and to verificate the sesion expired
* Use the `app.module.ts` for to declare the routes in the front and more (other restrictions)
* Use the `app.component.ts` for to indicate the use of our authentication service in ours base page (menu)
* Use the `app.component.html` for paste our html from menu
* For the additional components, it is used the same that previously described in the last steps
